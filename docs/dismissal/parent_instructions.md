###  Dismiss Students Button

You can click the Dismiss Student button to call for the dismissal of the students
that you are authorized to pick up. Students will only be dismissed if
you are within the allowed distance from the school and within the time period allowed.
Your browser will ask for permission to access your location. If you do not allow it,
you will not be able to use your device to dismiss the students.

### Select the students to dismiss

Depending on the school's settings, you may be presented with a list of
the students that you are authorized to dismiss. If you will not be picking up
all the students, deselect the students that you will not be picking up and
then click the Submit button.

### Verify that the students were dismissed

After clicking the button to submit the students, you should see the list
of students that were dismissed. If they were already dismissed, you
will be able to see who dismissed them and at what time they were dismissed.
If there are no more students to dismiss, you will see a warning telling
you that there are no more students authorized to be dismissed at this time.
