# Financial

EDUDATAS assists schools with their financial record keeping providing a list of Families that attend the
school and their financial records. When a new family enters the school, a Family record will be created.
From this family record, the students can then be entered into the system. Based on the Tuition Types,
Discounts and Payment plans set up by the school, Edudatas will figure out what the total tuition for this
family would be. The entries for the family's statements will be created automatically. The school
administrator can use these entries as predictions of what will be charged throughout the year. As each
month passes, statements with these charges can then be sent out to the family.

In order for EDUDATAS to know how much to charge and how to record it, you must set up certain tables that
keep track of the accounts, discounts, tuition rates, and payment plans. You can access each of these tables
under the Financial menu.
