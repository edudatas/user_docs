# Tuition Types


By setting up the Tuition Types and the corresponding Tuition Amounts, EDUDATAS can calculate the amount
that each family should be charged based on the school grades of their children. For most schools, only
one Tuition Type is necessary. If you want to have different types of tuition rates for example for
part-time students and full-time students, multiple types of accounts can be created. Another way to
handle the tuition differences would be to only have the one rate and offer more discounts. See the
section on **Discount Types** for more details.

- Name
  - The name for the Tuition Type.
- Tuition Amounts
  - For each of the Tuition Types, Tuition Rates will need to be created by clicking on the number in this column and then creating or editing the records. You can create a record for each School Level or School Grade for which you would like to set the rate. EDUDATAS will calculate a student's tuition using the School Level rate unless a more specific School Grade amount also applies. For example, if you create an Elementary rate of 1000, and a 1st Grade rate of 900, a student that is in the elementary would be charged 1000 unless the student was in 1st Grade in which case he would only be charged 900.
- Tuitionable
  - Choose the School Level or the School Grade for which the amount applies.
- Amount
  - Enter the **annual** amount that the student would be charged. This amount will be divided by the number of payments based on the Payment Plan chosen by the family.
- Students
  - This will show you a list of all the students that are being charged at this Tuition Type.
