# Setup

In order for EDUDATAS to know how much to charge and how to record it, you must set up certain tables that
keep track of the accounts, tuition rates, discounts and payment plans. You can access each of these tables
under the Financial menu. At the beginning of each year, you will need to update these tables before
calculating the families' charges for the year. You could also use the
<%= link_to('New Year Wizard', details_new_school_setup_path) %> to access these four tables easily.
