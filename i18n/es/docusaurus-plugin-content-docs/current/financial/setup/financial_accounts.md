When you are sure that you are done for this posting period, pick this option to store the current totals in the Previous balance column and to reset the Activity column to zeros. You can then begin to enter new items that would appear under the Activity column. Be sure to print the screen before you Update Previous so you can have a permanent record of this posting period.
